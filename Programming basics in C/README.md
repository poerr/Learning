# Programming basics in C

In this module we will be learning about all the basics of programming and the core concepts that every programmer must know. 

We will first be taking a look at variables, what are they, why do we need them, how are they stored under the hood and also we will be taking a look at variable types.

After we've covered variables it is time to move on to program control flow - the **if-else** and **switch** statements which are the core principles of telling the program how we want it to behave.

When we have done that, then it is time for a **test** that will require knowledge on previously mentioned topics.

After this, we will be taking a look at **arrays**, which will directly lead us to the to the matter of **pointers** and **references**.

Then, time for another test.
