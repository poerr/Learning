# Learning

Starting from 20.7.2024. this repository is meant to be a knowledge base of every topic I research and try to learn... that being said, I would like to try and do this as best as I can and be as thourough as possible so that anyone who looks at this will be able to understand the matter. Good luck!

Every folder will represent a module that encompasses a certain topic in-depth. In every module, there will be lectures in their separate folder with examples and explanations for everything and the folders will be marked with numbers to highlight in which order the lectures are supposed to be consumed.

Good luck!
